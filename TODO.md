# Migration Logging Optimization

## Issue
Verbose logging in migration script - same column identification messages repeated for every employee record (281 times)

## Plan Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Column Mapping Caching
- [ ] Add `self.column_mapping = None` to `__init__()` method
- [ ] Modify `_identify_employee_columns()` to cache results and remove repetitive logging
- [ ] Update `_get_cell_value()` to use cached mapping instead of calling `_identify_employee_columns()`

### Step 2: Optimize Logging Strategy
- [ ] Move column identification logging to only occur during analysis phase
- [ ] Replace verbose column logging with periodic progress updates during data extraction
- [ ] Keep essential error logging and summary statistics

### Step 3: Test and Verify
- [ ] Test migration to verify reduced log verbosity
- [ ] Confirm all functionality still works correctly
- [ ] Verify essential logging information is preserved

## Files to Modify
- `migrate_excel_to_db_corrected.py` - Main migration script
